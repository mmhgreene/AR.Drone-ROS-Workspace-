# AR.Drone-ROS-Workspace-

This GitHub repository was made for the change made in the following ROS packages: Ardrone_Autopilot, Ardrone_Autonomy, AR_pose, and Orb _Slam2. We were able to make some improvements to accomplish our goal as REU interns. our goal as REU interns was Homing while in a GPS Denied environment, to accomplish this we used an AR. Drone and ROS packages, to read and publish an AR.Marker. Then the drone will autonomously fly to the Marker location using Slam Created Map.
